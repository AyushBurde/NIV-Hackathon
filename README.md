Illegal Hoarding Detection System
This project was developed during the NIV Surat Hackathon 2023, where our team tackled the challenge of identifying illegal hoardings in urban areas. The system aims to automate the detection of unauthorized hoardings using computer vision and machine learning techniques. By leveraging these technologies, we created a solution that can assist authorities in quickly identifying illegal advertisements, improving city aesthetics, and ensuring compliance with local regulations.

Key Features:

Automated detection of illegal hoardings using machine learning models.
Real-time processing of image data from various sources.
Scalable and adaptable to different city environments.
Aiming to support city management in maintaining regulation compliance
